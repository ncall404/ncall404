## Hello there! I'm Nathan Call

### Current Status ðŸ“š
Currently, I am a student at Utah Valley University (UVU). I'm studying Information Systems with an emphasis in Application Development. I am also minoring in Computer Science.

### Goals and Use of GitHub ðŸ“‹
For now, my GitHub profile is mainly being used for school assignments and following projects I am interested in. I would, however, love to have some repositories for personal projects as soon as I can. I also hope to contribute to some open source projects at some point too!

### Interests ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®
Though I plan to do application development for my career (and am very interested in the subject), I am also interested in all sorts of technology. I enjoy keeping up on the latest in computer and gaming hardware as well as game development software.
