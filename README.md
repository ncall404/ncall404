## Hello there! I'm Nathan Call

### Current Status ðŸ“š
I just graduated from Utah Valley University with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems with an emphasis in Application Development and a minor in Computer Science. Now I'm working on some personal projects and doing some job searching.

### Goals and Use of GitHub ðŸ“‹
My GitHub profile contains personal projects, school assignments, and is used for following projects I am interested in. I also hope to contribute to some open source projects at some point too!

### Interests ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®
Though I plan to do application development for my career (and am very interested in the subject), I am also interested in all sorts of technology. I enjoy keeping up on the latest in computer and gaming hardware as well as game development software.
